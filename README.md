This project is meant to be part of the larger DietyTD game, namely for generating dynamic (and hopefully, attractive) backgrounds.

Implements an (at the moment) basic version of Draves' fractal flames. Still lacks:
- density estimation
- final transforms
- the full list of variations
- alpha channel?
- faster execution 
- looping (want to be able to make a finite sequence that can smoothly loop)
